# EnStrap.int

EnStrap.int is a user-friendly web-based application designed to support interactive visualisation of time-series differential gene expression data, focusing on uncovering metabolic flux changes. This application allows users to upload their gene expression data, including an annotation file, to generate dynamic metabolic pathway maps, explore pathway-level regulation patterns over time and under different experimental conditions, filter results by gene families or contrasts, and export the resulting visualisations for downstream use. 
The tool aims to empower researchers, especially those without programming expertise, to explore pathway-level changes over time and across experimental conditions.  

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3. For more information refer to the official [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page. The application is built using TypeScript/JavaScript for logic and functionality, HTML for structuring web content, and CSS for styling and layout.

## Installation 

To get the application up and running on users local machine, follow the steps below:

### 1. Cloning the Repository  
  Open the terminal or command prompt and run:  

  ```bash  
  git clone https://github.com/PaulaSawczuk/GroupProject-UGT-FEAS.git
  ```

  Alternatively, you can clone the repository directly using VS Code.

- Open the Project in Your IDE  
  Navigate to the project folder and open it using your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).

- Navigate to the kegg_pathway Directory
  The app must be run from the kegg_pathway directory. Move into this directory by running:

  ```bash
  cd ./kegg_pathway
  ```

### 2. Installing Dependencies  
  In the terminal, run the following command to install all required dependencies:  

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
### 3. Starting the Application  
  Once the installation is complete, start the application with:  

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  This will launch the app in your default web browser.
  
**Note:** Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system.

## Test Data and Data Format  

When EnStrap.int is launched, the data for testing the app can be accessed via [Test Data Folder on GitHub](https://github.com/PaulaSawczuk/GroupProject-UGT-FEAS/tree/main/TestData). The tool supports files in .csv and .txt formats only. The data must include at least one *expression file* and its corresponding *annotation file*.  

## Navigating EnStrap.int

### Welcome Page

  **For example:**
  If the user select the **Element**, a drop-down box (**J**) will appear displaying a list of elements relevant to the selected category in the current pathway. The user can scroll down through the list and click on a specific element to zoom into it within the visualisation display.  

###### ii). *Search For Pathway*  

If the user looking to search for a specific pathway: Next to "Pathway Ements" button (**D**) in the "Search" panel (accessed via the [View Menu](#3-view-menu)), click on the "For Pathway" button (**E**). Ihis will open a pop-up window containing two tabs that allow user to search and navigate different pathways.

*Fig.5d. Display pathways with hits and all KEGG pathways online.*  

**Highlight Tab:**
- This tab displays a table listing all pathways where hits were found in the uploaded expression files. Information about the total number of pathways and the number of pathways currently selected is shown above the table.
- To select pathways, tick the boxes in the "Select" column of the table (**L**) and to deselect a pathway, simply click the checkbox again..
- Use the "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons (**M**) to quickly select or deselect all pathways.
- Once user is satisfied with the selection,, click the "Search" button (**N**) to add the chosen pathways to the end of the pathway list in the sidebar.

The KEGG Online Search tab allows users to search for pathway names directly from the KEGG API by typing into the "Search Pathway Box" (**U**).  

- As the user begins typing, a list of matching pathway names will appear below the search box.  
- To add the pathway, simply click on its name and it will be added to the list beneath the search box (**P**).
- To remove a particular pathway, click **X** next to its name.
- Once the desired pathways are selected, click the "Search" button at the bottom of the page to add them to the end of the pathway list in the Sidebar. The user can add multiple pathways.

*Important things to note for the user:* 
- The pop-out window can be resized by dragging its bottom-right corner, allowing for a more comfortable view of the pathway table.
- Only one tab can be active at a time. Switching between tabs will reset any selections made in the previously opened tab.  

#### 4. Help Menu   
The Help Menu provides access to the [Guide Section](#guide-section), which users can refer to if they are unsure how to use a specific feature-especially when they are on the main application window rather than the [Welcome Page](#welcome-page). 


#### 5. Display Interaction  
 
 
#### 6. Time Series

*Fig.6. Time series animation display.*  

The figure above illustrate how users can explore different time points, as labeled in their uploaded expression files.
Use the slider (**A**) to move through the different time points and observe how the pathway changes over time.  

To create a timelapse animation of the pathway across all time points, click the "Animate" button (**B**). The animation will sequentially display changes across each time point, providing a dynamic view of pathway evolution.
