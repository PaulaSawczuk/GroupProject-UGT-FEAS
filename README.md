# EnStrap.int

EnStrap.int is a user-friendly web-based application designed to integrate and visualise KEGG pathways with time-series differential gene expression data, focusing on uncovering metabolic flux changes. This application allows users to upload their gene expression data, including an annotation file, to generate dynamic metabolic pathway maps, explore pathway-level regulation patterns over time and under different experimental conditions, filter results by gene families or contrasts, and export the resulting visualisations for downstream use. 
The tool aims to empower researchers, especially those without programming expertise, to explore pathway-level changes over time and across experimental conditions.  

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.3. For more information refer to the official [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) page. The application was built using TypeScript/JavaScript for logic and functionality, HTML for structuring web content, and CSS for styling and layout.

## EnStrap.int Test Data and File Format Requirements  

When EnStrap.int is launched, the data for testing the app can be accessed via [Test Data Folder on GitHub](https://github.com/PaulaSawczuk/GroupProject-UGT-FEAS/tree/main/TestData). The tool supports files in .csv and .txt formats only. The data must include at least one *expression file* and its corresponding *annotation file*. 

### File Format Requirements  
The tool is designed to work with two types of files that contain different information, identified by specific column naming conventions.  

#### 1. Expression File Format:

a). *Required columns:*  
- A column named "gene" (for matching genes across files).
- A column named "log2foldchange" (for file identification).  

b). *Format considerations:*  
- Column names are case-insensitive (can be upper, lower, or mixed case).
- The "gene" column must contain string data.
- The "log2foldchange" column must contain numeric data.



#### 2. Annotation File Format:

a). *Identification criteria:*   
Must have at least **ONE** of the following:
- A column named "sequence.name" (for gene matching) **OR**
- A column named "annotation.go.id" **OR**
- A column named "enzyme.code" **OR**.
- BOTH a column with "go" in its name **AND** a column with "enzyme" in its name (e.g., "annotation.go.id" and "enzyme.code" or any other column names containing these terms).


b). *Format considerations:*
- Column names are case-insensitive (the tool converts all to lowercase for processing).
- All columns in the annotation file should contain string data.  

The system ensures compatibility by transforming all column names to lowercase before processing, allowing users to enter column names in any case format while maintaining the tool's functionality.

## The Pathway Visualisation     
  
The pathway visualization was developed using the GoJS library, which provides powerful diagramming capabilities for complex biochemical networks. The figure below illustrates a representative example of the pathway visualization interface with its key interactive elements.   

![Visualisation_Image](https://github.com/PaulaSawczuk/GroupProject-UGT-FEAS/blob/main/kegg_pathway/src/assets/Visualisation_Image.png)    

### Visualisation Features  

**Linked Pathway:** Represented by the light blue rectangular box labeled (**A**), this element serves as a gateway to another pathway visualization. Clicking on this interactive element allows users to navigate to related metabolic pathways, facilitating comprehensive exploration of interconnected biochemical processes as below in [Display Interaction](#5-display-interaction).  

**Enzyme:** Depicted by rectangular boxes such as the one labeled (**D**), enzymes are color-coded to reflect differential gene expression levels. The color spectrum transitions from blue (**J**) to red (**B**), indicating varying degrees of expression. Gray enzymes (**D**) signify neutral expression levels, indicating no significant change in gene activity. The legend (**F**) in the bottom corner provides a complete reference for interpreting these color variations.    

**Compound:** Illustrated by gray circles (**C**), these elements represent metabolites or chemical compounds that participate in the biochemical reactions within the pathway.    

**Directionality:** The flow and reversibility of reactions are indicated by arrows (**G**) and (**H**) along with distinctive line styles. Reversible reactions are represented by segmented lines, while irreversible reactions are depicted with solid straight lines. These directional indicators convey crucial information through both their color and size. The color reflects the differential expression of the associated genes, while the arrow size corresponds to the relative log2fold change magnitude of that particular pathway segment. As evidenced by arrows (**G**) and (**H**), both color intensity and arrow dimensions vary to represent different expression levels and fold changes between conditions.  

**Pathway Magnifier:** The feature labeled (**I**) functions as a navigation aid, allowing users to zoom in or out on specific regions of interest within the pathway visualization. This feature enhances the examination of complex pathway sections by providing detailed views of selected areas.
